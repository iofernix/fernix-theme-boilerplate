# Fernix Theme Boilerplate

A standardized, organized, object-oriented foundation for building high-quality WordPress Plugins.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Pre-requisites

Create an environment variables `.env` file in the root directory. An example is available below.

```yaml
BUILD_PATH=./build
DIST_PATH=./dist
```

```
Give examples
```

## Installation

The Boilerplate can be installed directly into your themes folder "as-is". You will want to rename it and the classes inside of it to fit your needs. For example, if your theme is named 'my-theme' then:

* rename files from `plugin-name` to `my-theme`
* change `theme_name` to `my_theme`
* change `theme-name` to `my-theme`
* change `Theme_Name` to `My_Theme`
* change `THEME_NAME_` to `MY_THEME_`

It's safe to activate the theme at this point. Because the Boilerplate has no real functionality there will be no menu items, meta boxes, or custom post types added until you write the code.

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
